# Core Concept in React

## React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It has several core concepts that are crucial for developers to understand in order to build efficient and scalable applications. Here are some of the most known core concepts in React, along with simple explanations and sample use-cases, including code snippets where applicable:

### 1. Components

- **Explanation**: Components are the building blocks of any React application. They are reusable and can be either class-based or functional. Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be handled separately.
- **Use-case**: Creating a `Button` component that can be reused throughout the application with different properties.
- **Code-snippet**:
```jsx
function Button({ label, onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}
```

### 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)

- **Explanation**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like. It looks like HTML but is actually syntax sugar for `React.createElement()` calls.
- **Use-case**: Writing markup directly in JavaScript code.
- **Code-snippet**:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 3. State

- **Explanation**: State is an object that determines the behavior of a component and how it will render. State is mutable and local to the component it is declared in. It can be used in class components or in functional components using the `useState` hook.
- **Use-case**: Toggling a light switch between on and off states.
- **Code-snippet**:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function LightSwitch() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}>
      {isOn ? 'Turn off' : 'Turn on'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 4. Props

- **Explanation**: Props (short for properties) are how components talk to each other in React. They are immutable and allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
- **Use-case**: Passing a user's name to a `Welcome` component.
- **Code-snippet**:
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

### 5. Lifecycle Methods

- **Explanation**: Lifecycle methods are hooks that allow you to execute code at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as when it is created, updated, or destroyed. These are used in class components, but with React Hooks, you can achieve similar results in functional components.
- **Use-case**: Fetching data from an API when a component mounts.
- **Code-snippet**:
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data here
  }

  render() {
    return <div>My Component</div>;
  }
}
```

### 6. Hooks

- **Explanation**: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8. The most common hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Use-case**: Using the `useState` hook to track the state in a functional component.
- **Code-snippet**:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This code runs after every render
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 7. Virtual DOM

- **Explanation**: The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an in-memory representation of the UI is kept, which React uses to decide what changes need to be made to the actual DOM by comparing the current VDOM with the previous one.
- **Use-case**: React automatically managing updates to the DOM when the state of a component changes.
- **Code-snippet**: This is more of a concept than something you'd directly code, as React abstracts the Virtual DOM's complexity.

Understanding these core concepts is essential for working with React effectively. They form the foundation of how React applications are structured and behave.
